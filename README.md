# LakeDynamics

This Project is part of the course "Global Remote Sensing Applications"
of the EGALE Masters program of the university of Würzburg, supervised
by Dr. Maninder Singh Dhillon.

The aim of the project was the analysis of Lake Surface Area Variations
and the impact of climate variables of Lake Orog Nuur in Mongolia. The
Code for this project was written in Javascript within the Google Earth
Engine platform.

## Access the code

There are two options to access the code:

1.  To get a quick overview over the code follow the link below. It will
    lead to my GEE-repository, where you can try it.\
    \
    [GEE:
    LakeDynamics](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/elenascholz/CC2_DrylandDynamics)
   

3.  If you like to use the code for your own analysis use the provided
    Scripts in the Scripts-folder. There you will find all three
    Scripts.\
    You can copy them into your own repository.\
    **Note**: Start with the file "Variable Definitions". There you can
    change all parameters for the analysis.

## Acknowledgements
To implement the Scripts I used the Otsu Threshold. The function is
